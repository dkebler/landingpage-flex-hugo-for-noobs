Built in 1977 in Central Point, Oregon this 1548 sq. ft. Rambler/Ranch Style House has 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, covered patio, and an attached 2-car garage.  It would be perfect for two child family or a couple wanting a spare bedroom and an office.  Since 2007 the house has had numerous updates and is move-in ready.  It is located within easy walking distance to Central Point's high and middle schools as well as the Bear Creek Greenway, Jackson County Expo and a RVTD bus stop.
